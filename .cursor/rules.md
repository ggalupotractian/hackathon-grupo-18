# Project Instructions

- Use TypeScript for all new files
- Use only functional components in React
- Use icons from lucide-react if you need any icon
- Use components from shadcn/ui if you need UI components. You can ask me to download them if the component you want to use is not in the project yet
- Don't use React.FC to type components. Prefer typing the params directly, like ({ }: Props)
